## Welcome to Community Housing and Training (CHT) Center

' A center for a  comprehensive, innovative and responsive program in today's complex driven environment with the provision of educational services as well as livelihood skills training and values formation for strongaith in God and self-worth as human being with dignity.'

'The COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM aims to provide access to basic education
among the children, functional literacy, and livelihood for the parents and community-based education and learning facilities. It is an initiative that vigorously complements the overall thrusts and efforts to strengthen the basic education program of the government and particularly in the ARMM.'

'The CHT Program emerged  out of our concerns on the  experiences and felt needs of some sectors of the society; the war-affected children, youth and their families.'  

# Program and Project Rationale

'The prevailing condition of the educational system in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) paints a vivid picture that it lags behind in various aspects compared to the other administrative regions in the Philippines.'

'To a large extent, the underpinning grounds to this appalling state of education can be pointed mainly to the adverse and complex effects of the armed conflict that beset the region compounded by the rising criminalities and lawlessness, high incidence of poverty, poor delivery of and access to basic social services and the inadequate education budget from the national coffer.'

'Devastating and cruel, indeed, were the effects of the armed conflict, particularly the all-out wars of 2000 and 2003, to the educational system in the ARMM as well as to the delivery of the basic social services. The already dilapidated physical facilities and infrastructures were further demolished, number of drop outs continuously increases and the enrolment rates in both elementary and secondary levels went down tremendously due to the armed conflict.'

'It must be underlined that these wars had also rendered multifaceted traumatic experiences to the children, pupils, students of the ARMM, a focus and effective psychosocial intervention and debriefing program, therefore, must be instituted to address the said reality.'

'It has been said that the key to socio-economic development that would eventually diminish the abject poverty and underdevelopment as well as the armed conflict in the war-ravaged autonomous region is through educational advancement at all levels. But how can that be achieved if the aforementioned underpinning reasons to the appalling state of education in the ARMM will not be squarely responded to immediately by concerned institutions?'

'In the recent study of education in Mindanao, ARMM registered lowest in basic and functional literacy, secondary participation rate, elementary cohort survival rate and highest elementary drop-out rate. The basic and functional literacy rate is lowest at 61%. The secondary participation rate is also lowest at 39.19%. The elementary cohort survival is also modest at 33.96%. The elementary drop out at its meanest at 23.86%. (DepEd-ARMM Publication: Leading a New Beginning)'

'This dismal state of education in ARMM is equally true in most parts of its component provinces - Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Basilan. In fact, 21% of its 2,445 Barangays are without schools, which deprive the constituency of access to education.'

'**Hence, this COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM project proposal aims to provide access to basic education among the children, functional literacy, and livelihood for the parents and community-based education and learning facilities. It is an initiative that vigorously complements the overall thrusts and efforts to strengthen the basic education program of the government and particularly in the ARMM.**'

'The **CHT Program** will also provide **OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS TRAINING** for unskilled individuals and members of the family in order to enhance and to develop their capabilities and skills to augment their family income as well as **BASIC EDUCATIONAL SERVICES** outside of the formal school for less in education and school-age children and **LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT COUNSELING** and **VALUES FORMATION** for strong faith in God and individual's self-worth and dignity as human being and can be productive members of the society.'

'This proposal budget in the amount of **PhP 1,704,000.00** for Non-Housing and Administrative Components of the CHT Program will be sourced out in the form of solicitation for program’s assistance to generous and interested Donors, who are willing to help us for these charitable activities. The said assistance will be  **ESSENTIAL** and **PRIMARY** part of our program that permits our efforts in the field of **SKILLS TRAINING, EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES, COUNSELING and VALUES FORMATION activities**.'

'The program which we ENVISION is **COMPREHENSIVE** (*means programs that are complementary to each other in a typical community from educational, economic to social services*) and **INNOVATIVE** (*something that is new and original, programs’ approaches which are more innovative than those of their competitions, like; approaches to educational services outside of the formal school, It introduces changes and new ideas which are believed to be effective in today’s complex driven environment*).'

# Beneficiaries

' By raising the educational achievements of the poor illiterate population, the project will contribute to poverty alleviation through the inculcation of self-reliance and self-help capacities enabling them to participate in productive activities manage their limited resources better and reduce their dependencies on welfare and dole-outs. Increased functional literacy among parents would also improve school retention rate among their children and ensure that their children remain in school and attain higher levels of learning. In general terms, children whose parents have at least a basic education tend to do better in school than children whose parents have had little or no education. Studies have also shown a high correlation on literacy and education to lower birth rates, improve family health care, lower infant and maternal mortality rates.'

' The identification of target groups (learners) will be undertaken by means of a literacy mapping and the interagency consultative process. Those to be selected are the areas with high literacy rates, low participation rate in schools and high incidence of poverty.'

**The priority groups are**

'(i) victims of armed conflict who are illiterate and functionally illiterate Out-of-School Youths (OSYs) and adults; and'

'(ii) functionally literate OSYs and adults who have expressed interest to pursue continuing education programs (CEPs) or into vocational entrepreneurship trainings.'

' Priority consideration should be given to girls and women from the poorest households and members of cultural minority groups.'
